# jQuery NoGif

Pages with a lot of GIFs are often heavy to load. Also all GIFs usually load in paralell
and thus you have to wait until all GIFs are loaded before you can see the full cycle of
the first.

With this jQuery plugin you can create GIF-like animated image sequences, but with better
image quality by using JPEG/PNG images, basic playback control (play/pause/stop) and lazy
or queued loading of the images.
